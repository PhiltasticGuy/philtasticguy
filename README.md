### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software architect and full stack developer with over 15 years of experience in `.NET` and `Microsoft technologies`. In 2022, I completed a `Master's degree in Computer Science` at Avignon UniversitÃ© (France) where I finally had the opportunity to dive into `machine learning (ML)` and `natural language processing (NLP)`.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `HobbyStacks` and `TEAfam`.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about `React`, `Vue.js`, `microservices` and `domain-driven design (DDD)`.
- ðŸ’¬ I'm always available to chat about `elegant software solutions`, `cloud-native architectures` and `emerging/disruptive technologies`.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an avid rock climber, and I run half-marathons on trails to relax (preferably in the mountains).
